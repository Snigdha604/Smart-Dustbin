# ♻️ Smart Dustbin – Automated Waste Management System

An Arduino-based smart dustbin that automatically opens its lid when it detects nearby waste, improving hygiene and reducing manual contact.

## 🔍 About the Project
This smart dustbin system uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect the presence of an object (like a hand or trash) and automatically opens the lid using a **servo motor**. The project helps maintain cleanliness and promotes contactless waste disposal, especially useful in public places.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor
- Embedded C / Arduino IDE
- C++
- Breadboard, Wires, Power Source

## 🚀 Features
- Contactless lid opening
- Real-time distance sensing
- Low power consumption
- Compact and scalable hardware setup

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors for obstacles.
2. When an object is detected within a threshold distance (e.g., 15 cm), the servo motor opens the lid.
3. After a short delay, the lid automatically closes.
